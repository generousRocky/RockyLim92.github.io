In this project, I used TI CC2650 Sensortag to develop radio tomography in low-power sensor network device. I developed Contiki application and programmed it to the CC2650. By using CC2650 and Contiki, this radio tomography system could achieve low-power consumption.

### TI Sensortag CC2650

The CC2650 device is a wireless MCU targeting Bluetooth Smart, ZigBee and 6LoWPAN, and ZigBee RF4CE remote control applications. The device is a member of the CC26xx family of cost-effective, ultra-low power, 2.4-GHz RF devices. The ability to consume very low active RF and MCU currents and low-power mode currents provides excellent battery life for the device. This ability also lets the device operate on small coin cell batteries and in energy-harvesting applications. [1]

### Contiki

Contiki is an open source operating system for the Internet of Things. Contiki connects tiny low-cost, low-power microcontrollers to the Internet. Contiki is a powerful toolbox for building complex wireless systems. [2]
