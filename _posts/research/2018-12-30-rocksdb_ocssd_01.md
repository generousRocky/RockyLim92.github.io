# 1. Abstract
The role of high-performance storage devices is becoming increasingly important in the web-scale infrastructure. In particular, nextgeneration storage devices such as Non Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) based solid state devices (SSDs) are being actively introduced to data centers. However, applications running on data centers do not take into account the characteristics of these high-performance storage devices. We focus on the performance degradation of the mixed workload of reads and writes when using high-performance storage devices in the log-structured merge tree (LSM-tree) based database systems. To address this problem, we propose application-driven flash management scheme to isolate read/write operation.
